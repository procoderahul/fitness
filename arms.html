        A very simple exercise to build your bicep muscle. This exercise gives a
        great pump to your bicep. This exercise is usually performed at the
        beginning of the workout. You just have to get a dumbell to perform it.
        It can be performed both while standing as well as in seated position.
        You just have to curl the arm in such a way that the elbows remain
        contsantly at that position and the movement of the bicep muscle shall
        take place. You can see the correct way of the exercise in the video
        given below.

        An EZ-bar curl is, well, easy. Stand with your feet shoulder-width
        apart, knees slightly bent. Hold an EZ-bar in an underhand grip with
        your arms extended and then curl the bar up towards your chest, keeping
        your elbows in to your sides. The most important thing is to maintain
        the correct form and have the full range of motion.

        The hammer curl, also known as the dumbbell hammer curl or the neutral
        grip dumbbell curl, is a strength training exercise that targets your
        biceps and forearms. The hammer curl varies from the traditional bicep
        curl by using a neutral grip with your palms facing each other during
        the full range of motion. It mainly helps you to develop your brochialis
        part of the biceps.

        The spider curl is an isolation exercise that targets your arm
        muscles—specifically your biceps. Practice spider curls by resting your
        torso against an incline bench set to a 45-degree angle or a spider curl
        bench designed for this type of biceps exercise. Similar to
        concentration curls, spider curls require a slow, controlled movement
        from start to finish. Once you’ve mastered the dumbbell spider curl,
        consider using a different kind of free weight, like a barbell or an EZ
        bar with angled grips. With practice, spider curls can be a useful
        biceps workout to add to your bodybuilding routine.

        Grab a barbell with an overhand grip, keeping your index fingers on the
        inside edge of the knurling (i.e. the rough and textural part of the
        bar) Slightly arch your back to create minor space between your lower
        back and the bench. Life the bar off the rack and hold it above your
        sternum, keeping your arms completely straight and your elbows tucked at
        45-degree angles on either side. Lower the bar until it lightly touches
        your body, pause, and then drive through at your feet as you press the
        bar upward. For the last set, consider reducing the weight and then
        increasing the number of reps, pushing yourself to failure.
