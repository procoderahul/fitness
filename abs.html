      <h3>SCISSOR LEG RAISES</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>SETS: 3-4</li>
        <li>REP RANGE: 10-12</li>
        <li>REST BETWEEN EACH SET: 45-60 SECONDS</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This challenging but simple move is so effective ‚Äî and it specifically
        works the pesky lower ab area that can be difficult to work at times.
        You'll also take advantage of a nice quad exercise, which can help with
        running. Lie on your back with arms at your side. Pull navel into the
        spine. Lift both legs up at once until they are perpendicular to the
        floor. Slowly lower back down. Do not let back arch up off the floor.
        Add a scissor kick vertically and horizontally up to a few inches (legs
        stay straight and move up and down or side to side and crisscross each
        other).

        This reverse crunches are like the normal crunches but a bit easier one
        . To perform it: Lift your feet off the ground and raise your thighs
        until they're vertical. Keep your knees bent at 90 degrees throughout
        the movement. Tuck your knees toward your face as far as you can
        comfortably go without lifting your mid-back from the mat. Your hips and
        lower back should lift off the ground.
