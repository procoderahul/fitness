        weights above your head. Then slowly return to the starting position.

      <p>
        As the name suggests that this is exercise is a legendary exercise named
        after our legend Arnold Schwarzenegger. Start light until you master the
        form. Hold a dumbbell in each hand with your arm bent, as in the top of
        a biceps curl, so your palms are facing you. Now, instead of pushing
        straight up, spread your arms to each side laterally, then press your
        arms up and twist your hands so your palms face forwards. For full range
        of motion, finish by pushing your head forwards and reaching as high as
        you can so your biceps are close to your ears.

      <h3>DUMBELL SIDE LATERAL RAISES</h3>

      </ul>
      <p>
        This exercise focuses on your side delts / medial delts. The correct way
        to perform it is: Stand or sit with a dumbbell in each hand at your
        sides. Keep your back straight, brace your core, and then slowly lift
        the weights out to the side until your arms are parallel with the floor,
        with the elbow slightly bent. Then lower them back down, again in
        measured fashion ‚Äì you‚Äôll find it all the harder if you avoid speeding
        up. A lot of people will cheat by ‚Äúshrugging‚Äù the weights up using their
        traps. Resist the urge to do that by not raising your shoulder blades
        during the rep ‚Äì instead focus on the delts.

      <h3>SHOULDER UPRIGHT ROW</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>üéØ : LATERAL (SIDE) DELTOID</li>
        <li>SETS: 3-4</li>
        <li>REP RANGE: 10-12</li>
        <li>REST BETWEEN EACH SET: 45-60 SECONDS</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The upright row is considered one of the best muscle builders for the
        shoulders. It is also potentially dangerous for the shoulders, requiring
        perfect form for the best results and to avoid injury.Breathe in and
        brace the abdominals. Keep your back straight, chest up, and eyes
        focused forward. Lift the barbell straight up (toward the chin) as you
        exhale. Lead with the elbows and keep the bar close to the body. Your
        arms should go no higher than parallel with the shoulders; slightly less
        is okay. Pause at the top of the lift. Lower the barbell as you inhale,
        returning it to the starting position.

        against the chest pad and your back should be straight.Grab the inside
        horizontal handles with your palms facing down. Your arms should be
        slightly bent. Contract your rear deltoids to bring the handles back
        until they are roughly in line with your shoulders.Squeeze your rear
        delts hard in this position and slowly return to the starting position.
