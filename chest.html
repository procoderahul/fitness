        You need to set the cable of both the sides according to the part you
        want to focus on.
        <br />
        ::::::If you want to focus on the medial chest then place the cables
        parallel to your height and have the motion of flies.
        <br />
        ::::::: If you want to focus on the upper chest place the cables at the
        extreme end and the motion of flies upwards to target your upper chest.
        <br />
        ::::::: If you want to focus on you lower chest then place the cables at
        the extreme top and have the downward motion of the flies to target your

        This is the most underrated chest exercise which we rarely see at the
        gyms. For performing this exercies you need have a neutral grip and have
        the full upside-down motion. You have to bring the dumbell paralell to
        your medial chest to activate your inner chest. Make sure that you have
        the ful range of motion.

      <h3>SOME IMPORTANT TIPS</h3>
      <ul type="circle">
        <li>
          IN THE BENCHPRESSES, YOU SHOULD USE EITHER DUMBELL OR BARBELL BECAUSE
          THE MOTION IS SAME IN BOTH AND YOU WON'T GET ANY EXTRA BENEFIT OF
          DOING SO. YOU CAN PERFORM ALTERNATIVELY i.e. ONE DAY WITH DUMBELL AND
          OTHER DAY WITH BARBELL.
        </li>
        <li>
          CHEST IS A BIG MUSCLE SO IF YOU CAN THEN REPEAT IT TWICE A WEEK.
        </li>
        <li>
          TAKE THE LEAST POSSIBLE SUPPORT BECAUSE WHEN YOU TAKE THE SUPPORT YOU
          DONOT GIVE YOUR 100% EFFORT.
        </li>
        <li>
          PLEASE DONOT LIFT MORE THAN YOUR CAPACITY AS IT CAN CAUSE A SEVERE
          INJURY.
        </li>
        <li>
          DON'T DO TOO MANY EXERCISES OF THE SAME MOTION RATHER TRY DOING MORE
          EXERCISES OF DIFFERENT VARIATIN OF MOTION.
        </li>
        <li>CORRECT FORM SHOULD BE THE TOP MOST PRIORITY.</li>
        <li>
          WHILE PERFORMING FLIES MAKE SURE THAT YOUR ELBOWS ARE CORRECTLY
          POSITIONED AND WEIGHT IS NOT MORE THAN HEAVY AS IT CAN CAUSE INJURY TO
          YOUR ELBOWS.
        </li>
        <li>
          THE MOST IS IMPORTANT THING IS SQUEEZING YOUR CHEST AND HAVING THE
          PROPER FULL RANGE OF MOTION
